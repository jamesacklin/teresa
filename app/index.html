            <p>Lately I’m reminded of my grad schools days when I was completing my MA thesis, pushing to write another paragraph, another sentence. I was up to the challenge, as long as I had hazelnut coffee and Arcade Fire handy. Recently I realized how out of practice I am as I began penning my first long form piece in years, an essay on the development of City as Our Campus at WT. It’s not that I haven’t written over the past ten years but I’ve spent much of my time writing blog posts, presentations, newsletters, tweets, and other relatively short form pieces. In many ways I have been looking forward to this opportunity, especially as I read the “lengthy, relaxed, deeply rooted, literary non-fiction” that Tim Cook, founder of the Saxifrage School, has been sharing via Medium. His ability to interweave the story of an organization with deeply held beliefs and philosophical arguments is quite beautiful. He sets a high standard.</p>
            <p>In a recent article in Columbia Journalism Review David Remnick, editor of the The New Yorker, states that “even when it’s going badly” he finds writing to be “a sublime experience. Because you are alone, and you are in confrontation with the best you can do.” Indeed. I’m rediscovering myself as a storyteller and uncovering a deeper respect and understanding of the history and growth of the program I oversee.  Most surprisingly, the process has been deeply personal as I type, delete, rethink, retype my way to a particular tone and style.</p>
            <p>I’m just not sure it will be any good.</p>
